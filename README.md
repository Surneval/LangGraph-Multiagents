# LangGraph Multi-Agent Web Search System using GigaChat

## Overview

This project implements a multi-agent system using LangGraph to perform automated web searching, web scraping, text correction, and summarization with the help of GigaChat. The system follows a structured pipeline where each task is handled by a different agent.

## Workflow
	1.	CorrectorAgent: Corrects the user input for spelling or formatting errors.
	2.	WebSearchAgent: Performs a Google search for the corrected query and retrieves the top 10 URLs.
	3.	WebScrapperAgent: Scrapes text content from the retrieved URLs.
	4.	CorrectorAgent (again): Ensures that the scraped text is clean and properly formatted.
	5.	SummarizerAgent: Summarizes the cleaned web content into short, concise text.
	6.	FinalReportAgent: Saves the results (URLs + summaries) into a text file (search_results.txt).

## üìå Features
	‚Ä¢	Automated Web Search using Google Search API.
	‚Ä¢	Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup to extract page content.
	‚Ä¢	Text Correction using GigaChat.
	‚Ä¢	Summarization using GigaChat to generate concise summaries.
	‚Ä¢	Workflow Managed by LangGraph ensuring smooth execution.
	‚Ä¢	Saves Final Report to a TXT file (search_results.txt).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses LangGraph to define a graph-based workflow where each agent is a node and the execution follows a structured pipeline.

Agent Name	Function
CorrectorAgent	Corrects the user input
WebSearchAgent	Searches Google and retrieves URLs
WebScrapperAgent	Scrapes content from webpages
CorrectorAgent	Cleans up scraped text
SummarizerAgent	Summarizes the extracted text
FinalReportAgent	Saves results into a file
